## Is Quotex Legal in India?

The legality of Quotex in India is a complex issue. The platform is not
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which is
the regulatory body for financial markets in India. This means that
Quotex is not subject to the same regulations as other financial
institutions in India.

SEBI has issued a warning against binary options trading, stating that
it is a high-risk investment and that investors should be aware of the
risks involved. However, SEBI has not specifically banned Quotex or any
other binary options trading platform.

Therefore, the legality of Quotex in India is a gray area. The platform
is not regulated by SEBI, but it is also not specifically banned. This
means that it is up to individual traders to decide whether or not they
want to trade on the platform.
